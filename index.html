    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Yo! Iâ€™m a student just vibing through life. I got into coding for fun, and now itâ€™s lowkey my thing. Itâ€™s crazy how I went from messing around to actually building stuff, and Iâ€™m all for it. Thereâ€™s just something about creating something from scratch that hits different.
        <br>
Besides coding, Iâ€™m also super into video editing. Iâ€™ve been editing videos for a while now, mostly for funâ€”whether it's gaming clips or random stuff. Editing just feels like a way to put my thoughts out there and make something cool out of nothing.
<br>
And donâ€™t even get me started on gaming. Itâ€™s my first love, fr. Whether Iâ€™m grinding solo or playing with friends, Iâ€™m always up for a new game. Itâ€™s more than just a hobby, itâ€™s my escape, my way of chilling, and a place to just enjoy myself.
<br>
I'm always down to learn new stuff and push my limits. So yeah, that's meâ€”coding, editing, and gaming all day, every day. Letâ€™s connect and make some cool things happen!</p>

      <h3>Tic-Tac-Toe Game</h3>
      <p>This was one of my first small projects. I made it with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
      Itâ€™s simple but I had fun building it and making the design look neat.</p>

      <h3>10th Grade Notes Website</h3>
      <p>I created this site to make studying a bit easier. It has short notes and 
      easy explanations for all major subjects so it helps while revising quickly.</p>

    <div class="project-card">
      <h3>Cosmology Theories</h3>
      <p>This oneâ€™s about mind-blowing ideas of the universe. I gathered different
